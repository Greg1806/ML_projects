# Machine Learning projects
Projects found on Kaggle, other coding platforms or created out of self interest

## Projects description

* **Credit Card Fraud detection - Anomaly detection (imbalanced dataset)** - *"Kaggle_CC_Fraud_detection"*
  <br> i) Focus on trying to improve Logistic Regression model through several technics including Grid Search optimizing for F1 and AUPRC

* **Airbnb users 1st booking destination prediction** - *"Kaggle_airbnb"*
  <br> i) Focus on EDA, data cleaning and feature engineering to feed model with best features to predict in which country new Airbnb users will make their 1st booking

* **People Analytics: End-of-year clustering understanding and prediction** - *"PeopleAnalytics_endofyear_perf"*
  <br> i) Impact of key metrics on end of year performance (inferential) and test of basic ML classification models and PCA to predict end of year cluster (prediction)

* **(Non-ML) People Analytics exercices from Keith McNulty's Handbook "Regression Modeling in People Analytics"** - *"PeopleAnalytics_exercices"*
  <br> i) Several advanced regression technics mostly focusing on inferential (vs predictive) analytics
  
* **Expedia Hotel Ranking** - *"Hotel_Ranking_Kaggle"*
  <br> i) Building models to rank properties based on search made by customers and highest chances of being booked
  <br> ii) Comparing performane of pointwise vs. pairwise "learning to rank" techniques

* **Fantasy Premier League best team selection** - *"Fantasy_moneyball_project"*
  <br> i) Identify key statistics and metircs behind FPL - validating or not assumptions, myths and beliefs
  <br> ii) Compare different models (LinearRegression, KNN, RandomForest) performance while attempting to predict weekly points per players based on key features identified
  <br> iii) Pick best team (maximizing number of points) per game weeks using LinearProgramming (PulP library)
